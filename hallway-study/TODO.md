BAD IDEA (but keeping the description around for posterity):
 I'd like to completely change the center zone. It will no longer be for pads -- it will determine the current chord
within the current progression. There will be 4 trigger zones, and each will represent one of the chords in the
current progression. THe progression will still change automatically, as will the key. But the chord will be based
on 
The chords section would be an 8x8 grid where one dimension is notes and the other is a “chord progression”
The key would still change periodically and automatically.
Immediate feedback is important, so the chord section would actually play the chord when it is triggered. Fast attack but long sustain
I'd like to try using the center zone as the "cords" zone. It will only have 4 triggers intead of 16. Each of the 4 sections will represent a progression in the active key. (I-V-vi-IV, vi-IV-I-V, I-IV-V-I, I-vi-IV-V, I-IV-vi-V, I-V-IV-V). The progression will still swap out every 4 bars, an the key will still change automatidally. But instead of just automatically progressing through the chord progression, it will be based on who is standing there.
