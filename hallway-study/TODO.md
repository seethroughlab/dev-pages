- I'd like to try using the center zone as the "cords" zone. It will only have 4 triggers intead of 16. Each of the 4 sections will represent a progression in the active key. (I-V-vi-IV, vi-IV-I-V, I-IV-V-I, I-vi-IV-V, I-IV-vi-V, I-V-IV-V). The progression will still swap out every 4 bars, an the key will still change automatidally. But instead of just automatically progressing through the chord progression, it will be based on who is standing there.
